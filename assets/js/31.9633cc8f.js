Having clean, easy-to-read code makes you stand out as a programmer and makes it easier for others to use and work off of.\nâ€‹")]),a._v(" "),e("h2",{attrs:{id:"classes"}},[e("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#classes"}},[a._v("#")]),a._v(" Classes")]),a._v(" "),e("p",[a._v("Classes should be named in UpperCamelCase.
